"""Optional request/response recorder, enabled with ``--record-responses DIR``.

When a record directory is configured, every HTTP request the suite makes and
the response it gets back are written to plain-text files, organised one folder
per test:

    DIR/<test-name>/<model>_input.txt    # the request body/bodies (pretty JSON)
    DIR/<test-name>/<model>_output.txt   # the raw response body/bodies

The model id is part of the filename (``/`` sanitised), so a multi-model
comparison writes every model's I/O side by side in the same per-test folder --
handy for eyeballing what each model actually received and returned (e.g. the
reasoning split, a tool-call leak, double-BOS) without re-deriving it from
pass/fail. A test that makes several calls appends them in order.

This is a passive recorder: it never changes what is sent or asserted, so it
keeps the suite's "general capability" behaviour identical with or without it.
