"""multiturn suite -- multi-turn conversation state. See SPEC.md 7.5.

Deterministic via a sentinel the model can't guess: state a code early, ask for
it later, assert the exact code comes back. mt-tools (a tool call mid-
conversation) is covered by the tools suite's tools-multiturn, which currently fails
on the -tools build (server chat-template bug), so it is not duplicated here.
