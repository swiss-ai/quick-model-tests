"""streaming suite -- SSE streaming behavior. See SPEC.md 7.2.

Deterministic structural checks only (SPEC.md 6): chunk count, stream
termination, finish_reason presence, stop-sequence honoring. The SSE framing is
itself under test, so stream-basic parses the raw wire bytes.

Note (2026-06): the swissai endpoint does NOT emit a `data: [DONE]` sentinel --
it terminates with a usage chunk (`choices: []`, `usage: {...}`). stream-basic
accepts either terminal convention. See SPEC.md 7.2.

stream-equiv (concatenated stream == non-stream content) is intentionally NOT
implemented yet -- it depends on temperature=0 determinism (open question 5),
which is unconfirmed for this endpoint.
